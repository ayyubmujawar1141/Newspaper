            DC Comics concept art of Bruce Wayne by Mikel Jan√≠n
            Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the
            murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman
            persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal
            residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off
            his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.[77][78] He supports
            philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues
            encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.[79]
            In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip while
            feigning near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since Wayne is actually a
            strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess.[80] Although Bruce Wayne leads an active
            romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time.[81]

            Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade.[82] This is
            in contrast to the Post-Crisis Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity, while the Superman
            persona is the facade.[83][84] In Batman Unmasked, a television documentary about the psychology of the
            character, behavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's
            inherent humanity; that "Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is
            ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better". Bruce Wayne's principles include the
            desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill. Bruce Wayne believes that our actions define us, we
            fail for a reason, and anything is possible.[85]

            Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary
            depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison[86] notes that both heroes "believe in
            the same kind of things" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. Morrison notes an
            equally stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social
            classes: "Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss." T. James Musler's book Unleashing the Superhero in Us All
            explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the
            crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman.[87]

            Will Brooker notes in his book Batman Unmasked that "the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the
            young audience ...he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and
            most importantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him ...and they're
            never wrong."[88]</p>
